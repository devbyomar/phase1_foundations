# Phase 1: Foundations of Data Engineering

Welcome to **Phase 1** of my data engineering bootcamp. This project is hands-on, code-driven, and follows real-world practices inspired by FAANG engineering teams.

## 🔍 Goal

Build a modular, testable, and scalable Python codebase that fetches, processes, and stores data from public APIs — starting with YouTube trending videos.

## 📦 Technologies

- Python 3.11
- `requests` — HTTP API calls
- `pydantic` — Data validation
- `typer` — CLI applications
- `dotenv` — Secure API keys
- `pandas` — Data transformation

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devbyomar/phase1_foundations.git
cd phase1_foundations
python3 -m venv phase1_env
source phase1_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
